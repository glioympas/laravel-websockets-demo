## laravel-websockets demonstration

A quick simple app that demonstrates the usage of the package. This enables real time functionality on our apps , with websockets usage.  Pretty self explanatory when you open the app on the browser.

Don't forget to run php artisan **websockets:serve** command to start the websockets server.

Creating real time web apps was never so easy like that. I am surprised.
